description: Generate AI music from the terminal using the `sunox` CLI. Use when user asks to "generate a song", "make music", "create AI music", "make a track", "generate audio", or wants to programmatically use Suno web workflows for custom lyrics, tags, voice personas, playlists, covers, remasters, speed/reverse/crop/fade edits, or generation-backed stems. Also use when downloading Suno songs (prepared MP3 auto-embeds lyrics; explicit m4a/wav/opus supported). Run `sunox agent-info` for the static machine contract and authenticated `sunox capabilities` for the current account. NOT for writing song prompts/lyrics without generating audio.

# sunox CLI

Generate AI music from your terminal using direct Suno web workflows, including custom lyrics, style tags, voice personas, playlists, covers, remasters, speed/reverse/crop/fade edits, stems extraction, and word-level timed lyrics.

## When to use

- User wants to **generate** AI music programmatically through the sunox CLI
- User wants to **download** Suno songs (default MP3 auto-embeds USLT + SYLT lyrics into ID3 tags; explicit m4a/wav/opus supported)
- User wants to **batch generate**, **script**, or **integrate** Suno into a music workflow
- User mentions Suno, AI music generation, or wants to control Suno parameters from the terminal

## When NOT to use

- Writing song lyrics or Suno-formatted prompts without actually generating audio
- General music theory, composition advice, or non-Suno music tasks

## Setup (first time on a new machine)

```bash
# Auto-extract auth from browser (Chrome / Arc / Brave / Firefox / Edge)
sunox login

# Verify it worked
sunox doctor

# Diagnose DNS/direct-TCP/HTTPS connectivity when auth or API requests cannot connect
sunox doctor --network
sunox doctor --network --strict  # non-zero when a requested network path is degraded
```

If `sunox login` fails on a headless box, fall back to:

```bash
printf '%s' "$SUNOX_COOKIE_INPUT" | sunox auth --cookie-stdin
printf '%s' "$SUNOX_JWT_INPUT" | sunox auth --jwt-stdin
sunox auth --refresh                                      # force-refresh stored Clerk session
```

## Discovery

Always start by reading machine-readable capabilities:

```bash
sunox agent-info        # JSON: commands, models, exit codes, features, env prefix
sunox capabilities      # live account: plan, models, limits, feature/CLI coverage
sunox --help            # full subcommand list
sunox <cmd> --help      # flags for a specific subcommand
```

## Agent integration

This skill is intended for Codex-style coding agents that need a deterministic
tool contract. Install it with:

```bash
sunox install-skill --target codex
```

Use `--json` whenever you need to parse command output. The human-facing
surface is intentionally small (`sunox <prompt>`, `sunox create`, `sunox
download`, `sunox add --to`, `sunox login`, `sunox doctor`). For automation,
use the resource commands exposed by `sunox agent-info`.

Suno write commands are account-scoped serial by default to avoid accidental
same-account concurrent mutations. Use `sunox config set serial_mutations false`
to persistently disable this behavior, `-c serial_mutations=false` for one
invocation, or `--parallel` for one command.
Agents should not pass --parallel or disable `serial_mutations` unless the user
explicitly asks to allow same-account concurrent writes.
For an audit or inspection that must not write, pass global `--read-only`; it
blocks write requests before submission, disables timed-lyrics augmentation,
and refuses missing WAV/OPUS conversion. Prepared downloads remain possible and
may still consume plan allowance.

Risk control defaults for agents:

- do not run multiple same-account write commands in parallel unless the user
  explicitly asks for parallel writes or has disabled serial mutations.
- do not publish clips, playlists, or personas, or make them public, unless the
  user explicitly asks.
- do not run delete, trash, purge, `empty-trash`, or similar destructive commands
  unless the user explicitly asks. `clip purge` and `clip empty-trash` are
  irreversible. When explicitly requested, pass `-y/--yes` because destructive
  commands require it.
- for unattended generation that must not add a Suno tab to the active browser
  window or launch a separate browser process, use the Browser Bridge installation
  as the command-selection boundary. When installation has been confirmed on the
  current machine, omit `--no-captcha`; both `challenge_browser=auto` and
  `challenge_browser=existing` then create one nonce-bound Suno iframe inside the
  extension's invisible offscreen document and fail closed when the Bridge is
  unavailable. The frame is removed on every terminal path; no user-opened or
  retained Suno tab, popup, minimized browser window, or separate browser process is
  created. Only the first-level extension-owned frame with the exact nonce can
  connect. The frame uses the current Chrome profile's Suno context, stops and
  replaces the host response at
  `document_start`, and connects only after its one-time carrier request marker,
  document nonce, request headers, and controlled response headers are verified.
  The fixed `https://suno.com/` root is only an origin carrier: response rules
  remove `Location`, `Set-Cookie`, and other side effects before execution.
  Location-suppressed standard redirect responses remain controlled documents;
  any redirect Chrome actually follows fails closed. Unexpected navigation,
  caching, reload, disconnect, protocol drift, or any failed identity check removes
  the frame and fails closed; there is no visible or isolated-browser fallback. The
  Turnstile path removes and rebuilds the widget exactly once when the first
  15-second silent attempt produces no callback. Both widgets share one absolute
  30-second budget after SDK readiness. A classified provider callback never
  triggers another fresh widget, while Turnstile's bounded same-widget recovery
  remains enabled inside that budget. A request for visible interaction fails. The same
  flow is supported on macOS and Windows. Confirmed installation is standing permission to run
  challenges through that managed context; do not ask for per-run captcha permission.
  Interpret "no retained Suno tab", "no new browser process", "no
  visible captcha", and equivalent requests as allowing the installed Bridge, not
  as `--no-captcha`; `challenge_browser=existing` remains the explicit Bridge-only
  override. Use `--no-captcha`
  despite an installed bridge only when the user explicitly forbids every
  challenge mechanism, including the invisible Browser Bridge, or explicitly
  requests that flag.
  When the bridge is not installed or installation is unknown, keep
  `--no-captcha` so a required challenge stops before submission. The default
  `challenge_browser=auto` may open an isolated browser only when no Bridge
  installation has been recorded. A recorded installation still fails closed
  if its pairing secret is later missing. Use `challenge_browser=isolated`
  explicitly when a separate challenge browser is acceptable.
  Do not force `--captcha` unless the user asks, and prefer an externally supplied
  `--token` when provided.
- never print or commit cookies, Clerk values, JWTs, challenge tokens, or other
  auth material.

## Instrumental input modes

Choose exactly one mode; Sunox rejects combinations instead of silently dropping
the lyrics input:

- For an unconstrained no-lyrics instrumental, use `--instrumental` without
  `--lyrics` or `--lyrics-file`.
- For controlled sections, rhythm, edit points, or arrangement, omit
  `--instrumental` and use `--lyrics-file`. The first line must be
  `[Instrumental]`; keep every remaining non-empty line inside square brackets so
  there is no singable body text.

```text
[Instrumental]
[Intro — sparse felt piano, free time]
[Build — strings enter and the pulse accelerates]
[Final cut — hard unresolved ending]
```

After generation completes, inspect every candidate before downstream selection:

```bash
sunox clip wait <clip_id> --json
sunox clip timed-lyrics <clip_id> --json
```

If timed lyrics contain any entry with `success=true` and a non-empty aligned
`word`, reject that generated version. Do not publish, download as a selected
result, or add it to a playlist; do not delete it unless the user explicitly asks.

Treat commands that return new or processing clips as asynchronous workflows.
After `sunox create`, `sunox clip reuse`, `sunox clip inspire`, `sunox clip cover`, `sunox clip
extend`, `sunox clip underpaint`, `sunox clip overpaint`, `sunox clip concat`, `sunox clip stems`,
`sunox clip remaster`, `sunox clip speed`, or
`sunox clip reverse` returns a new/processing clip ID, call `sunox clip wait
<clip_id> --json` before download, quality filtering, or playlist decisions
unless the user only asked to submit. `sunox clip crop` and `sunox clip fade`
already wait for the resulting clip to complete, so a successful response from
either command does not require another `clip wait`.

For simple audio analysis, prefer existing media by reading `audio_url` from
`sunox clip info <clip_id> --json`; do not download unless a file is needed.
`clip info`
also returns song-page context such as attribution, comments,
`remix_count` (`count`, `is_capped`, and additional upstream fields), and
`similar_clips` in JSON. If a non-auth,
non-rate-limit supplemental read fails, the base clip still returns and JSON
includes `supplemental_errors`; auth and rate-limit errors still abort
normally. Do not trigger new Suno generation/export work just to inspect audio.
Reserve WAV or generation-backed stems for explicit deep-analysis, lossless,
or stem requests. Studio functionality is outside this CLI's scope.
The current CLI download defaults to Suno's official prepared MP3 endpoint and
supports `--format mp3|m4a|wav|opus`; `--video` uses `clip.video_url` when
present. WAV/OPUS are GET-first; add `--no-convert` to forbid the conversion
POST when no file exists. Downloads may be plan-metered.
`sunox clip stems` performs generation-backed stems extraction; it is not the
same as Suno Web Pro Get Stems export.

Download output directories are created automatically. Existing local files are
preserved by default; only pass `--force` when the user explicitly asks to
replace the matching downloaded file.

## Generation parameters reference

| Flag | What it does | Range / format |
|---|---|---|
| `--title` | Song title | ≤ 100 chars |
| `--tags` | Style direction | Read `max_lengths.tags` from `sunox models --json` |
| `--exclude` | Styles to avoid | Read `max_lengths.negative_tags` from `sunox models --json` |
| `--lyrics` / `--lyrics-file` | Custom lyrics, or bracket-only structure beginning with `[Instrumental]` | Read `max_lengths.prompt`; conflicts with `--instrumental` |
| `--prompt` (describe mode) | Free-text description | Read `max_lengths.gpt_description_prompt` |
| `--model` | Live account model selector | built-in default is v6 Pro `chirp-hawk`; exact external key, account model ID, or unambiguous display name |
| `--duration` | Requested duration in seconds | v6 Custom: whole seconds 10–360, default 180; exact v5.5 compatibility path; account max when advertised |
| `--vocal` | Vocal gender | male, female; custom mode uses Web's `metadata.vocal_gender` |
| `--persona` | Voice persona UUID | from Suno voice creation |
| `--weirdness` | How experimental | 0–100 |
| `--style-influence` | How strictly to follow tags | 0–100 |
| `--variety` | v6 creativity variant | whole number 0–4; requires session flag `aug-creativity`; gated defaults are 0 on v6-wild and 1 on other v6 models |
| `--mumble` | Request v6 non-lexical vocals | requires both the model feature and live session flag `mumble-mode` |
| `--max-mode` | Request Max Mode | account/session/model-gated; final duration and charging are server-authoritative |
| `--enhance-tags` | Call Suno's tag upsample flow before submit | explicit opt-in |
| `--instrumental` | Unconstrained no-lyrics instrumental | conflicts with `--lyrics` and `--lyrics-file` |
| `--token` | Externally supplied challenge token | only when Suno challenges the request |
| `--captcha` | Force browser-backed challenge verification | runs even when preflight says unnecessary |
| `--no-captcha` | Disable automatic browser verification | challenge preflight still runs |

## Models

Do not assume a fixed version list. Run `sunox models --json` or
`sunox capabilities --json` immediately before model-sensitive work. The
default is the concrete v6 Pro selector `chirp-hawk`; it still requires an exact
usable match in the live billing response. Explicit `default_model=auto` resolves
a usable account default, then a usable free default, then the first model whose
`can_use` field is true. An explicit
selector requires a successful billing read and must match a usable live model;
duplicate display names require an exact external key or account model ID.

Remaster uses its separate live model array and account feature gate. Before
submission, run `sunox clip actions <id> --json`; the CLI itself also requires
an exact, complete, non-trashed, non-infill source no longer than 960 seconds
whose `remaster` action is visible and enabled. `chirp-bass` omits
`variation_category` and rejects an explicit `--variation`. v6 Remaster uses
`chirp-halibut`, sends variation `normal` and style profile `boost` by default,
and accepts variation `subtle|normal|high` plus style profile
`natural|boost|clarity`. Do not send the lower-level builder's tags or slider
fields: the current v2 modal does not expose them and live checks did not prove
ordinary-account support. Automatic model
selection skips future unknown request shapes and fails closed if no known
Remaster model remains. For supported rows, both the display name and external
key emitted in `capabilities` are accepted by `--model`.

## Agent-friendly output

- Every command supports `--json`. JSON is **auto-detected** when stdout is piped.
- Progress messages and errors go to **stderr** so they don't pollute JSON pipelines.
- Commands submitted through `/api/generate/v2-web/`, plus `clip remaster`, preserve the upstream
  clips envelope exactly in `.data`; read submitted clip IDs from `.data.clips[].id`. `clip concat`
  preserves its upstream bare Clip object, whose ID is `.data.id`. Table output uses the parsed
  clip view.
- Suno write commands are account-scoped serial by default; do not pass --parallel or disable `serial_mutations` unless the user explicitly allows same-account concurrent writes.
- For simple audio analysis, prefer clip `audio_url` media from `sunox clip info <clip_id> --json`; use the prepared download command only when a local file is needed. `clip info` also includes `attribution`, `comments`, `remix_count`, `similar_clips`, and non-fatal `supplemental_errors`. Reserve explicit formats, generation-backed stems, or Pro video for requests that name that format or need deep/lossless analysis. Studio functionality is outside this CLI's scope.
- A transport/body interruption after generation, Remaster, conversion, or a submitted edit can return `ambiguous_mutation`. Never blindly replay it; inspect `error.details.operation_id`, `recovery.resumable`, and read-only inspection commands first.
- `clip cover-art image` and `clip cover-art video` discover model categories, allowed durations, and cost at runtime, then return a two-result batch. They require exact authenticated clip ownership, explicit non-trashed state, the enabled `generate_cover_art` action, and the matching plan feature. They never auto-apply a candidate. Use `status`, `pending`, and `history` for recovery, then explicitly select `apply-image` or `apply-video` with the batch ID; apply first proves that the completed result belongs to the selected clip. A lost submit response is never replayed because the batch protocol exposes no client idempotency key.
- Download output directories are created automatically. Do not pass `--force` unless the user explicitly requests replacing an existing local download; ordinary downloads refuse to overwrite a matching file.
- MP3 downloads abort on auth/rate-limit failures while fetching timed lyrics. Other timed-lyrics failures preserve the MP3 with available plain lyrics and add a structured `warnings` entry. Downloads have a two-hour total deadline and 2 GiB size limit; Ctrl-C cleans staging files.
- `--quiet` suppresses download progress and ordinary status output. A batch download that has already written any output and then fails returns `partial_download`; inspect `error.details.succeeded`, `error.details.failed`, and `error.details.not_attempted_clip_ids`, then retry only the required IDs.
- `playlist remove` submits one remove request per clip. If a later clip fails, JSON errors use code `partial_mutation`; inspect `error.details.succeeded_clip_ids`, `error.details.failed`, and `error.details.not_attempted_clip_ids` before retrying.
- Multi-clip `publish`, `unpublish`, `like`, and `dislike` also run serially. If a later clip fails, inspect the same `partial_mutation` progress fields and retry only failed or unattempted IDs.
- Multi-step playlist create/set, local image upload, clip cover update, and audio upload failures use `partial_mutation` with resource IDs, `completed_steps`, `failed.step/code/message`, and `recovery`. Follow `recovery.command` only when `recovery.resumable=true`; never replay a mutation marked false. Use `sunox clip upload-status <upload_id> --json` for a read-only audio upload status check.
- Do not publish, make public, or run destructive commands unless the user explicitly asks for that action; destructive commands require `-y/--yes`.
- Errors include actionable suggestions in the JSON envelope.

```bash
# Pipe-friendly: auto-JSON
sunox clip list | jq '.data.clips[0].title'
sunox clip info <clip_id> --json | jq '.data.audio_url'
```

## Exit codes (semantic)

| Code | Meaning | What the agent should do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1 | Runtime, web endpoint, partial/ambiguous mutation, or partial download error | Inspect `error.code`, `error.details`, and `recovery.resumable` before retrying |
| 2 | Config error | Fix config, do not retry blindly |
| 3 | Auth error | Run `sunox login` |
| 4 | Rate limited | Wait 30–60s, then retry |
| 5 | Not found | Verify the resource ID |

## Common workflows

### Generate and download a finished MP3 with synced lyrics

```bash
sunox create --title "Foo" --tags "ambient, piano" --lyrics-file foo.txt
sunox clip wait <clip_id>
sunox clip download <clip_id> --output ./out/
# → ./out/foo-<clipid8>.mp3 with USLT + SYLT lyrics embedded
```

### Resume / continue a clip

```bash
sunox clip extend <clip_id> --at 60.0 --lyrics "[Verse 2]\n..."
sunox clip wait <new_clip_id>
sunox clip concat <new_clip_id>           # stitch into a full song
```

Use `clip concat` with a source that has original Suno generation history. Do
not assume crop, fade, reverse, or other edited results are valid inputs: Suno
can reject them with `Bad history.`

### Batch download yesterday's songs as JSON, then pull MP3s

```bash
ids=$(sunox clip list --json | jq -r '.data.clips[].id')
sunox clip download $ids --output ./archive/
```

## Notes

- Auth refreshes automatically (~7-day session lifetime).
- On Windows, `sunox login` skips live Chromium cookie databases so App-Bound
  decryption cannot force-close the user's browser. Firefox uses its safe
  read-only SQLite path. The dedicated interactive fallback requires an
  installed Chromium-family browser when no reusable session is found.
- Browser-derived request context is real-value first: `sunox login` links cookies
  to the matching local profile and probes the same installed browser binary for
  runtime user-agent, language, and client hints without a visible window.
  Legacy auth is repaired before the next authenticated command. Fresh values
  win per field, stored values survive a failed probe, and built-in constants
  are only the final fallback for browser UA/language fields. A same-account
  browser `Device-Id` is recovered when possible, otherwise omitted rather
  than replaced with a fabricated identity. Conditional `Referring-*` fields
  are not invented without real navigation/referrer context.
- Generation metadata fills `user_tier` from the current account's
  `/api/billing/info/` `plan.id` when available, and falls back to an empty
  value when that read is unavailable.
- Do not fabricate tag-upsample metadata. In captured web flows,
  `metadata.last_tags_generation` is only present after a real
  `/api/prompts/upsample` response; use `--enhance-tags` when the user asks for
  Suno to enhance tags, otherwise omit it. Its tags/request_id come from the
  response; `personalization_enabled` follows the captured submit shape. The
  submit also marks `override_fields=["tags"]`. Vocal requests pass current
  custom lyrics as upsample context; instrumental requests omit lyrics.
- Commands that submit through `/api/generate/v2-web/` preflight `POST /api/c/check` with `ctype=generation`; if Suno reports a challenge and stored Clerk refresh material exists, Sunox refreshes the JWT once and repeats the preflight. When a challenge remains, `challenge_browser=auto` first uses the installed Browser Bridge. The extension creates one nonce-bound Suno iframe inside Chrome's invisible offscreen document, uses the current Chrome profile's Suno context, installs controlled request and response rules before loading the fixed `https://suno.com/` origin carrier, stops and replaces the host response with a provider-only challenge document before host scripts run, and removes the frame on every terminal path. It does not discover or follow an application route. Response rules remove `Location`, `Set-Cookie`, and other side effects; a Location-suppressed standard redirect response may remain as the controlled document, but any redirect Chrome actually follows fails closed. A first Turnstile no-callback result rebuilds the widget exactly once; both widgets share one absolute 30-second budget after SDK readiness. Classified provider callbacks never trigger another fresh widget, while Turnstile's bounded same-widget recovery remains enabled within that budget; visible-interaction requests fail immediately. It creates no user tab, popup, minimized browser window, or separate browser process, and it never falls back to a visible or isolated-browser context. This flow is supported on both macOS and Windows. If a Bridge installation has been recorded but is unavailable or its pairing secret is missing, `auto` fails closed; it falls back to the matching isolated browser only when no Bridge installation has ever been recorded. hCaptcha uses provider 1 and Cloudflare Turnstile uses provider 2 according to `captcha_version`. Install or update the optional bridge with `sunox install-browser-extension --force`; never install or reload a browser extension without the user's authorization. The Bridge manifest uses its independent runtime build, so CLI-only releases do not require Reload. Installer JSON keeps `runtime_ack_pending=true` until the exact runtime and pairing authenticate. A first install returns `reload_required=null`, `pending_origin=load_unpacked`, and `activation_required=load_unpacked`; complete Load unpacked, then run `sunox doctor --browser-bridge`. A normal acknowledged update returns `reload_required=true` and `activation_required=reload`. Uncertain or restored browser state returns the single decision `activation_required=ensure_loaded`; its `activation_options` are mutually exclusive condition-labelled branches, never a sequence. Exact acknowledgement returns `reload_required=false,runtime_ack_pending=false`. Doctor sends missing or repairably corrupt pairing values through one managed `--force` repair, but unsafe or inaccessible secret entries such as symlinks, non-UTF-8 data, directories, or unreadable paths fail closed and must not be claimed repairable by force or Reload. When no challenge is required, `token` and `token_provider` are serialized as `null` to match the current Web client.
- Prefer `--token <solved>` when an external token is already available. Use `--captcha` only to force verification even when preflight says it is unnecessary, or `--no-captcha` to disable automatic browser verification.
- Generation paths (normal, describe, voice persona, reuse, inspiration, cover, extend,
  underpaint, overpaint, and generation-backed stems) use `/api/generate/v2-web/`; those
  public generation commands expose `--token`, `--captcha`, and `--no-captcha`.
- `sunox lyrics` discovers the currently confirmed Cowrite models with
  `GET /api/generate/cowrite-lyrics/models/`, then uses the synchronous
  `POST /api/generate/cowrite-lyrics/` fresh-generation contract. That POST was
  re-confirmed in the current first-party interaction chunk and an authorized
  minimal submission during the preceding August 24 protocol audit. The 0.3.0
  Cowrite implementation verification made no additional account writes. It does
  not use the removed submit/status polling flow.
- Source-dependent commands read clips through the current
  `GET /api/clip/{id}` route; multi-clip polling uses feed/v3 exact-ID filters.
  Cover uses `task=cover`, `generation_type=SIMPLE_REMIX`,
  `metadata.create_mode=simple`, `metadata.is_remix=true`, and the source title.
  It validates account availability on the base model before mapping v3/v3.5
  to `chirp-v3-5-tau` and v4 to `chirp-v4-tau`; v4.5-all keeps the explicit
  `chirp-auk-turbo` Web override.
- Inspiration uses one source clip and the live-captured playlist-conditioned
  request; `--audio-influence` maps to `metadata.control_sliders.audio_weight`;
  do not invent uncaptured instrumental or multi-source inputs. Extend uses
  `task=upload_extend` for uploaded audio and `task=extend` otherwise, sets
  `metadata.lyrics_updated` only when replacement lyrics were supplied, and
  uses feed/v3 exact-ID metadata enrichment only when the current single-clip
  response lacks source style metadata. It defaults `title`, `tags`,
  `negative_tags`, and `make_instrumental` from the source when available; use
  explicit flags to override them.
- Timed lyrics use the current v3 start/poll contract; v2 is compatibility
  fallback only. Remaster and speed use their current Web edit/generation
  routes. `sunox clip list` filters are query-only, and
  `/api/clips/get_similar/` remains a supplemental song-page read.
  `sunox clip stems` is not the same as Suno Web Pro Get Stems export.
- Persona list/detail/clips/create/set/publish/unpublish/love/unlove/toggle-love/delete/restore/purge are available through `sunox persona ...`. The removed processed-clip status route has no current Web equivalent; use `persona info` for current vocal clip and range fields.
- Playlist create/list/detail/metadata/add/remove/publish/reorder/save/unsave/like/dislike/restore/delete are available through `sunox playlist ...`; use `playlist set <id> --image-file <path>` for local cover uploads.
- Clip delete/restore/purge and like/dislike are available through `sunox clip delete`, `sunox clip restore`, `sunox clip purge`, `sunox clip like`, and `sunox clip dislike`. `sunox clip empty-trash -y` permanently deletes every trashed clip. Purge and empty-trash are irreversible and require an explicit user request. `--clear` removes the selected reaction.
- `sunox clip upload <file>` uploads local audio through Suno's presigned S3 flow, waits for processing, initializes a clip, and can set title/lyrics metadata. Uploaded local clip covers are applied by `image_s3_id`; arbitrary external URLs use `image_url`. `sunox clip upload-status <upload_id>` only reads an existing upload's processing status.
- `sunox config set <key> <value>` persists local defaults; `SUNOX_*` environment variables override persisted config.
- When the CLI returns `schema_drift` (Suno changed its web schema), run `sunox update` to pull the latest binary from GitHub Releases.
- When unsure about flags, run `sunox <command> --help` or `sunox agent-info`.
